[[{"l":"About Me","p":["I was recently laid off at Apollo GraphQL and have prior experience fullstack at Apollo GraphQL, ServiceNow, IoTeX, and NASA. Feel free to reach out, would love to chat more :)","Hi! I'm Jeffrey \uD83D\uDC4B. I'm a Taiwanese American \uD83C\uDDF9\uD83C\uDDFC \uD83C\uDDFA\uD83C\uDDF8 software engineer born and raised in the Bay Area, CA. I graduated from Cornell University in 2022, with a bachelors degree in Computer Science. As a developer, I'm constantly in the pursuit of learning and seek to better myself everyday.","Outside of work, some of my passions include number one, weightlifting \uD83C\uDFCB️. I love going to the gym and lifting heavy weight. Number two, surfing \uD83C\uDFC4‍♂️. It's a new hobby I picked up during quarantine but it's super fun and I suggest you try it too. I often drive down to Santa Cruz where the conditions are best. No. 3, fashion \uD83D\uDC58.

I wanted to be able to learn both languages so what better way to learn a programming language than by coding out a game!","Coded from scratch with \uD83D\uDC99. You may experience a few strange bugs (easter eggs) LOL."]},{"l":"Spotify Friend Activity","p":["Have you ever noticed that in spotify mobile, you can't see what music your friends are listening to while you can on the desktop app? This frustrated me so I decided to create a solution of my own.","Preview from deployed app!","Spotify Friend Activity was built with React, React Static, Node, and Express. Hosted on Render! The idea was to be able to see my friend's spotify activity easily via a web app."]},{"l":"How I made it","p":["TLDR: By intercepting Spotify Desktop's web requests, I was able to locate the endpoint Spotify used to get friend data. I then found the token they used to authenticate and hit it via a CORs proxy.","To start, I needed a way of getting that friend data which wasn't publicly documented in Spotify's public API. By intercepting Spotify Desktop's web requests, I was able to locate the endpoint Spotify used to get this data. Having located the endpoint, all I had to do was hit it and voila, right???","Well first I needed to figure out what authorization tokens were required to authenticate with that endpoint. After some time digging, I found that a certain cookie used by Spotify's Desktop app was required to access the API.","Next, I tried calling the API from Postman but kept getting CORS errors! To get around this, I deployed my own CORS proxy ( View on Github) to hit the endpoint for me. At last! I was able to get my friend's music data in JSON form!","The last and final part was taking the JSON data and creating a pretty React app to display this data. For this, I decide to use a React-Static app that called my deployed CORs proxy. Some cool features I added include being able to play the music from the web app and being able to see if their playing live via a live music animation."]},{"l":"IoTeX Codelabs","p":["IoTeX Codelabs provides guided, tutorial, hands-on coding experience for IoTeX developers. The entire website including all the tutorials within were designed / coded by me. Every tutorial includes real code snippets that you can follow to do cool stuff, such as deploying a d-App, decentralized application on the blockchain!","IoTeX codelabs!","I just noticed but for some reason when you click into a codelab on the website it displays a white screen instead of the original content. I believe this is a version compabitability error as it's running a really old version of React. As I coded this as part of my internship in 2018, I no longer have the perms to fix this. You can still inspect element to see that the original content exists, but it won't show it beautifully like how I intended unfortunately.","Making this website involved knowledge of React, HTML, CSS, JS, and Solidity for the coding tutorials! Some examples of the tutorials include deploying smart contracts, d-Apps, and even a tutorial for how other develops can contribute their own codelabs to be included in the website. This was a really fun project where I learned a ton of new technologies and build something cool from scratch!"]},{"l":"More projects","p":["I have many more cool projects on Github, such as a Naruto platformer game in Golang, etc. which I didn't get the chance to write up and feature here yet!
